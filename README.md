# A Maven archetype to generate Pi4J V2 project skeletons

This Maven archetype can generate Pi4J-V2 project templates with remote build, run and debug capability.
A template project generated with this archetype can:

- Handle a connection to many Raspberry Pi targets, configured in the pom.xml file
- Compile your code, packing the compiled code in a jar, uploading it and all the other required jars on the selected remote target
- Run the program on the remote target
- Open a remote debugging session

The archetype is IDE agnostic (_I tested it using Netbeans_) and depends only on Maven and ant. You should be able to use it with your preferred IDE 
program (Netbeans, Eclipse, Idea or whatever else).

# Getting started

Follow these steps to set up the archetype and use it:

## Install Maven

You must have the Maven tool installed on your computer. If not, you can download it from https://maven.apache.org/

## Install the archetype to your local .m2 repository

- Unzip the archetype file in a _FOLDER_
- `cd FOLDER/pi4j-maven-archetype`
- `mvn install`

## How to generate a new PI4J V2 skeleton project

Now suppose you want to begin a new PI4J-V2 project _my-project_:
- `mkdir my-project`
- `cd my-project`
- `mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local`
- answer to the questions asked (see below for details)

### Configuring your new project

Before starting the new project generation, the archetype asks you some configuration data:

1. _Choose archetype:_ select the _raspimaven-archetype_ from the list shown
1. _Define value for property 'groupId':_ choose the Maven groupId for your project. (If don't know what is a groupId, don't worry, just type _com.example_)
1. _Define value for property 'artifactId':_ choose a name for the program executable your project will produce
1. _Define value for property 'version':  1.0-SNAPSHOT:_ type Enter to accept the default value shown, or type the initial version, something like _1.0.0_
1. _Define value for property 'package':  com.example:_ type Enter to accept the default value shown

The archetype now presents to you a summary of the configuration parameters you have just typed in, plus the values proposed 
for the _main-class_ and _package_ parameters. If the list is ok for you, reply _Y_ to accept, otherwise reply _N_ to change 
one or more values (you will have to re-type all parameter values ...)

After the list confirmation, the archetype generates a new maven project for you. You should be able to open the new project 
with your preferred java IDE. The IDE should be able to recognize the project as a valid Maven project.

### How to generate from a remote repository (optional)

If you deploy the archetype in a remote repository, use this command to generate a new skeleton project:

`mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=it.lb.rasp -DarchetypeArtifactId=raspimaven-archetype -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT`

# The generated skeleton project

You can now freely modify the new project, adding your code. The following is a guide on using the new project features.

## How it works ##

This project skeleton allows you to write the source code of your RPI programs using a destop computer (Linux or Windows) 
and your preferred IDE as development station, uploading the executable code to a remote RPI board, running and also debugging 
your code remotely.

### What do you need

- The development station must be connected to your local network
- A target RPI board must also be connected to the same network
- You must configure the target RPI for a _Headless connection_ with the development computer, i.e. the _ssh_ server must be enabled in your
RPI board and you must be able to connect with a ssh terminal.

#### How to configure

The configuration data about the target RPI remote board is stored in the file _platform/raspberry.properties_. Actually 
the folder _platform_ can contain as many *target_name.properties* as the RPI boards you may want to connect to. The maven 
property _target.platform.name_, defined in the _pom.xml_ file, points to the right file in the _platform_ folder. The 
default configuration file is _platform/raspberry.properties_ and the _target.platform.name = raspberry_ 

#### Configure the _platform/raspberry.properties_ file

Each xxxx.properties file in the _platform_ must be edited to describe the configuration data of a specific RPI board, as follow:
- the target RPI IP address, the ssh connection port, the username and password
- instead of using a password, if your RPI is configured to accept a ssh key, you can specify your ssh key.
- the location of the java JRE / JDK on remote target, the folder where the program executables must be uploaded
- ... other details described in the raspberry.properties 

## How to build, run and debug your project

The project declares in the _pom.xml_ the following maven/ant goals that you can execute with the command shown :
- `mvn clean` : delete all compiled files from local and remote project
- `mvn install` : builds the project, uploads the required jars to the remote target RPI board
- `mvn antrun:run@exec` :  runs the program on the remote target
- `mvn antrun:run@debug` : runs a remote debugging session on the target RPI.

All the modern IDE programs have a mechanism to configure new GUI commands linked to a specific maven goal. See below 
for an example of such a GUI configuration of the Netbeans IDE.

### Note on running a debug session

To start a debugging session: 
- run the command `mvn antrun:run@debug`, the program on the remote target starts with JVM in debug mode, waiting for a debugger connection on the port configured for the target
- in your IDE start the debugger setting the host IP = _target IP_ and port = _port configured in raspberry.properties_
You should be able to set remote breakpoints, execute step by step, examine variables on your remote program.

### Note on the Java runtime

If you are not using the default Raspberry Pi OS full edition and/or included Java, you may get this kind of error:

```shell
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-antrun-plugin:3.0.0:run (exec) on project ...: An Ant BuildException has occured: The following error occurred while executing this line:
[ERROR] ...\antrun\build.xml:166: The following error occurred while executing this line:
[ERROR] ...\antrun\build.xml:123: Remote command failed with exit status 1
[ERROR] around Ant part ...... @ 9:59 in ...\antrun\build-main.xml
```

This can be caused by a mis-configured Java runtime. The default value in `raspberry.properties` is:

```
target.remote.jre=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
```

Check if this value exists and links to your Java runtime, or find the location of your installed JDK with 
`sudo find / -iname java` and use the result in your configuration.

For instance: a Raspberry Pi Zero (type 1) with ARMv6 requires a specific Java version for this type of processor. This
is described more in detail on ["Java for ARMv6/7/8"](https://pi4j.com/documentation/java-installation/). If you use Azul 
Zulu JDK, you will need to change the configuration to:

```
target.remote.jre=/usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf
```

## Some final notes ##

### PI4J version

The _pom.xml_ file adds the pi4j v.2.1.0 jar dependencies to the project classpath. You may want to update to the latest version

### File "_nbactions-template.xml_"

If Netbeans is your preferred IDE you can use the file nbactions-template.xml to add to the Netbeans GUI the two actions 
"Remote run" and "Remote debug". Follow these simple steps:

1. Right click the project in the NBs _Projects_ window and select _Properties_
1. Select _Actions_ --> _Build project_
1. Click on _Add_ button and select _Skip Tests_
1. Click _OK_ - (this forces Netbeans to generate the file _nbactions.xml_ in the project folder)
1. Open the file _nbactions.xml_ and _nbactions-template.xml_
1. Select the two _Action_ XML elements with name _CUSTOM-Remote run_ and _CUSTOM-Remote debug_ and copy them to the _nbactions.xml_. - Pay attention to preserve the correct XML syntax of file _nbactions.xml_, and save it.

Now right-click the project in the NBs _Projects_ window and select _Run Maven_: you should see the two new goals _Remote run_ and _Remote debug_

When done, you can safely delete _nbactions-template.xml_
